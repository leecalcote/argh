# are you a Docker Captain?
You already know what you need to do but if you don't remember follow this points:

* Create a feed with your contants about docker (it's really important. Just docker!).
* Create a PR and update `/feeds.txt` with your feed.

This feed is generated every three hours (0-3-6...)
